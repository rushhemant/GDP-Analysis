# GDP-Analysis
The overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states.

The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states.
